  return `= arc42 Architecture Documentation Workflow Guide

== Overview

This guide helps you document your software architecture using the arc42 template. The arc42 template is a practical, proven template for documentation of software and system architectures.

== Available Languages

This arc42 MCP Server supports multiple languages for documentation:

[options="header",cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Code |Language |Native Name
|EN |English |English
|DE |German |Deutsch
|CZ |Czech |Čeština
|ES |Spanish |Español

|IT |Italian |Italiano
|NL |Dutch |Nederlands
|PT |Portuguese |Português
|RU |Russian |Русский
|UKR |Ukrainian |Українська
|ZH |Chinese |中文
|===

== Getting Started

=== Step 1: Initialize Your Workspace

Use the \`arc42-init\` tool to create your documentation workspace:

[source]
----
arc42-init(projectName: "My Project", language: "EN")
----

You can specify a different language using the ISO language code.

=== Step 2: Check Status

Use \`arc42-status\` to see the current state of your documentation:

[source]
----
arc42-status()
----

=== Step 3: Generate Section Templates

Use \`generate-template\` to get detailed templates for each section:

[source]
----
generate-template(section: "01_introduction_and_goals", language: "EN")
----

== The 12 arc42 Sections

. *Introduction and Goals* - Start here! Define what you're building and why.
