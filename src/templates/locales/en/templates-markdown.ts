  return `# arc42 Architecture Documentation Workflow Guide

## Overview

This guide helps you document your software architecture using the arc42 template. The arc42 template is a practical, proven template for documentation of software and system architectures.

## Available Languages

This arc42 MCP Server supports multiple languages for documentation:

| Code | Language | Native Name |
|------|----------|-------------|
| EN | English | English |
| DE | German | Deutsch |
| CZ | Czech | Čeština |
| ES | Spanish | Español |
| FR | French | Français |
| IT | Italian | Italiano |
| NL | Dutch | Nederlands |
| PT | Portuguese | Português |
| RU | Russian | Русский |
| UKR | Ukrainian | Українська |
| ZH | Chinese | 中文 |

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Initialize Your Workspace

Use the \`arc42-init\` tool to create your documentation workspace:

\`\`\`
arc42-init(projectName: "My Project", language: "EN")
\`\`\`

You can specify a different language using the ISO language code.

### Step 2: Check Status

Use \`arc42-status\` to see the current state of your documentation:

\`\`\`
arc42-status()
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Generate Section Templates

Use \`generate-template\` to get detailed templates for each section:

\`\`\`
generate-template(section: "01_introduction_and_goals", language: "EN")
\`\`\`

## The 12 arc42 Sections

1. **Introduction and Goals** - Start here! Define what you're building and why.
2. **Architecture Constraints** - What are you NOT allowed to do?
3. **Context and Scope** - What's in and what's out?
4. **Solution Strategy** - High-level approach to solving the problem.
5. **Building Block View** - Static structure of your system.
6. **Runtime View** - Dynamic behavior and scenarios.
7. **Deployment View** - How is it deployed and operated?
8. **Cross-cutting Concepts** - Patterns used across the system.
9. **Architecture Decisions** - Important decisions and their rationale.
10. **Quality Requirements** - Concrete quality scenarios.
11. **Risks and Technical Debt** - What could go wrong?
12. **Glossary** - Define your terms.

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Section 1** - Understanding goals is fundamental
2. **Keep it concise** - arc42 is pragmatic, not bureaucratic
3. **Use diagrams** - A picture is worth a thousand words
4. **Document decisions** - Future you will thank present you
5. **Iterate** - Architecture documentation is never "done"

## Tools Available
